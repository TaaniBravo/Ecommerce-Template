# Holy Grail: An ecommerce template üè¨

## Overview

Holy Grail is an ecommerce store featuring some of the most hype brands around!

This template is help expand my horizons past classic MVC architecture and work in a layered architecture. I study principles by Uncle Bob, Eric Evans, Martin Fowler, and Khalil Stemmler trying to self teach myself enterprise architecture and what it means to write clean code following the SOLID, DRY, and YAGNI principles.

My main focus for this full length project is to create an Object Orientated/Test-Driven codebase using Express, Node.js, and TypeScript to make sure that I am writing code that I can write once and use everywhere.

For the React side of things I plan to use Functional Components as this passing state to components is much more clear than in Class Components. While I could use Class Components to follow a more traditional OOP style project, I think that Functional Programming is best used here. At the end of the day clean code is my goal here.
